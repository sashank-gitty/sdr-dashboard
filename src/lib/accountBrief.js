// Derives the account brief — the "What You Need to Know" surface — from
// an account's own signals.
//
// A hard rule runs through this whole module: **nothing here invents a
// fact about a real company.** Every string that reaches the screen is
// either (a) copied verbatim from an ingested signal, or (b) a count,
// date or grouping computed from those signals. There is no generated
// prose about what a company "is focused on", no synthesized executive
// quotes, and no firmographics.
//
// That constraint is why this file produces *themes with citations*
// rather than paragraphs. The reference product fills these panels with
// LLM-written narrative over earnings calls, SEC filings and job posts —
// sources this pipeline does not ingest. Writing that narrative anyway,
// from ANZ news headlines alone, would produce confident sentences about
// real companies that nothing in the data supports, and a rep would
// repeat them on a call. Grouping the real signals under the same
// headings keeps the layout and the scan-ability while every claim stays
// clickable back to its source.
//
// If the pipeline later ingests earnings transcripts or filings, this is
// the one module that changes: the panels and citation plumbing already
// exist.
