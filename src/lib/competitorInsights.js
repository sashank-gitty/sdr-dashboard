// The Competitor Intelligence equivalent of signalInsights.js — but it
// answers a different question on purpose. signalInsights.js is written
// for a signal about an account you could sell into: what does this
// mean for them, who feels it, how do you open a conversation. None of
// that applies to a signal about Sprinklr, Medallia, or any other name
// in shared/competitors.js — you cannot call a competitor and pitch
// them. What's actually useful about a piece of competitor news is
// entirely different: what changed, why it matters for how you talk
// about Qualtrics against them, and what to watch for next.
//
// Same hard rule as signalInsights.js and accountBrief.js: nothing here
// invents a fact about a real company. Every sentence is a generic,
// defensible read keyed off the signal's own fields (signal-type group,
// practice area) — what's generically true of *a competitor doing this
// class of thing*, not a specific claim about Sprinklr or Medallia. The
// specific fact stays in the headline and summary above it.
