// Colour is reserved for the few things that are genuinely a "look here
// first" signal — regulatory/pain-point urgency (rose) and a matched
// account's customer/prospect status (emerald/amber). Everything else
// that used to be its own tinted pill (signal type, practice area,
// patch, scope) is the same neutral chip: with every metadata field
// independently coloured, no single colour meant anything.
//
// The category colours in lib/signalGroups.js are the deliberate
// exception, and they don't contradict this. They ride on the icon badge
// that fronts a row — one tinted glyph tile per row, learned once — not
// on the metadata pills trailing it. One coloured mark plus neutral
// chips stays scannable; eight coloured chips does not.
//
// Every class is a full literal string (never built by concatenation) so
// Tailwind's scanner picks it up. Pills are borderless light-tint chips
// to match the shared Pill component — shape is uniform system-wide, so
// tint is free to carry meaning.
