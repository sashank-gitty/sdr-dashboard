// A deeper, multi-part read on a single signal, for the detail drawer's
// insight section — the "why does this matter and what do I do with it"
// depth the one-line reason/action pair didn't have room for.
//
// Same hard rule as accountBrief.js and signalReason.js: nothing here
// invents a fact about a real company. Every sentence is a generic,
// defensible read tied to the signal's own fields (signal-type group,
// practice area, account status, score) — the kind of thing that's true
// of *any* signal shaped like this one. The specific fact is always the
// headline and summary already on screen above this section; this module
// explains why that class of fact tends to matter and what an SDR
// typically does with it, it does not claim anything new about the named
// company.

// Keyed by signal-group id (see signalGroups.js). `impact` is what this
// class of signal usually means for the account itself; `who` is who
// inside or around the account actually feels it — the "what this means
// for consumers / employees / everyone" layer, since the account isn't a
// single person.

      "A new leader in this seat typically opens a 60–90 day window where vendor relationships, budgets and existing tooling get reviewed fresh. Priorities the previous leader had settled are back up for debate — that window closes once they've made their first calls, so it's worth more now than it will be in six months.",
    who: "Whoever reports into this seat is watching for early signs of what the new leader changes first. Frontline teams usually find out about a re-platforming decision only after it's made, not before — which is exactly the gap an outside conversation can fill.",
  },
  hiring: {
    impact:
      "An open req for this role — especially at leadership level — is one of the earliest advance signals available: a company rarely hires into a function without also planning to review how that function operates. It's worth more right now than the eventual appointment announcement, because there's no incumbent relationship for the new hire to defend yet.",
    who: "Whoever's covering this function without a dedicated leader today is absorbing the gap. The person who eventually fills the role is the one who'll actually make the buying call once they land — getting in front of the requirement itself, before that person is named, is the advantage.",
  },
  regulatory: {
    impact:
      "Regulatory or compliance pressure like this usually forces a named internal owner and a budget line even when the account hasn't gone to market for a vendor yet — it's a mandate, not a discretionary spend, which changes how fast a deal can move once it starts.",
    who: "The customers or employees the regulation exists to protect are the ones who feel the operational strain first, well before it shows up in a boardroom deck. That lived experience — not the regulation's text — is the sharper thing to reference.",
  },
  earnings: {
    impact:
      "A result this public becomes the lens leadership judges every initiative through for the following quarter: cost discipline after a miss, or investment appetite after a beat. Either way, whatever gets funded next has to visibly answer to this number.",
    who: "Investors and analysts are the stated audience for the number, but the operating consequence — headcount, spend, which initiatives survive — lands squarely on the teams underneath them.",
  },
  funding: {
    impact:
      "Fresh funding, a partnership or an M&A event almost always comes with a stated reason attached — growth, product expansion, market entry. That stated reason, not the transaction itself, is the actual opening: it tells you what they're about to be measured on.",
    who: "Employees and the market read this as a signal of direction. If it's a partnership or acquisition, the combined entity's customers are the ones whose day-to-day experience is about to change, often before internal teams have fully worked out how.",
  },
  research: {
    impact:
      "A published analyst view or research shift resets how this account gets compared to its peers. Accounts move quickly to either defend a position that reads well or explain away one that doesn't — both are live conversations right after publication, not evergreen ones.",
    who: "Whoever owns competitive or brand positioning internally is the one under sudden pressure to respond to an external framing they didn't write.",
  },
  transformation: {
    impact:
      "A transformation or restructure this visible almost always has a stated 'why' attached — cost, growth, or customer experience. That stated reason is the pretext to use; the reorg itself is just the mechanism.",
    who: "Employees living through the change and the customers who experience its output are both directly affected, and both are legitimate angles — one is an internal-friction story, the other is a service-quality one.",
  },
  news: {
    impact:
      "Product, brand or market moves like this are the account publicly staking out a position. That's a live, current-events reason to ask how the move is actually landing internally — the press release and the internal reality are rarely the same story.",
    who: "The account's own customers and the market watching the move are the two audiences it's trying to win over. Which one they're more worried about disappointing is usually the more interesting question to ask than the move itself.",
  },
  community: {
    impact:
      "This is community-sourced intelligence rather than published news — useful as texture and as an early read on the account, but treat it as a lead to verify rather than a citable fact to put in an email.",
    who: "Whoever the insight names or describes is worth privately confirming before it's referenced outward in any outreach.",
  },
  other: {
    impact:
      "This signal doesn't fit a specific playbook yet — read the headline and summary above for the actual substance and use judgment on how directly it ties to this account's situation.",
